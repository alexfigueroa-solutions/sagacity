Sagacity displays matching files along with their summaries, allowing you to view file contents with syntax highlighting.\n\n- **Chat Mode**: Engage in interactive conversations with the Claude AI, asking questions about your codebase. The AI provides contextual responses based on relevant file contents.\n\n- **Conversation History**: Save and load conversation histories with the AI, enabling you to revisit previous discussions.\n\n- **Command Palette**: Access various actions like switching modes, printing the index, or quitting the application.\n\n- **Autocompletion**: Enjoy autocompletion functionality when typing commands or file paths.\n\n### Getting Started\n\n1. Install Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n2. Obtain an Anthropic API key and add it to your `~/.zshrc` file as `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"your_key_here\"`\n3. Build the project: `cargo build --release`\n4. Run the application: `./target/release/sagacity`\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests.\n\nFor more information, refer to the project's README.md file.",
